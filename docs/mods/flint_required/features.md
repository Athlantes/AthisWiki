# Flint Required

Experience a more authentic start to survival with primitive tools, realistic progression, and meaningful resource gathering.

Flint Required removes hand-punching trees and rebuilds early gameplay around crafting with flint, fibers, and natural materials. Earn every advancement and feel the weight of real survival.

## 🪨 Primitive Survival Start
- You can’t break logs with bare hands anymore.
- Gather natural resources and gradually progress.
- Early gameplay becomes immersive, challenging, and rewarding.

## 🔧 Flint Toolset
- Smash Flint on Stone to create Flint Shards.
- Craft tool heads with them and assemble primitive axes, pickaxes, knives, and more.
- Requires Flint Head + Plant Fiber + Sticks.

## 🌿 Gathering Reworked
- Plant Fiber drops from grasses (100% with a Flint Knife).
- Crude Brush turns Gravel into Flint reliably.
- Saplings can be crafted into Sticks.

## 🔥 Progress With Purpose
- Stone tools require actual Stone, not cobble.
- Cook Cobblestone on a Campfire to obtain Stone.
- Use Stone to craft a primitive Furnace and continue progressing.

Flint Required brings back the struggle, effort, and satisfaction of early survival—without breaking vanilla balance.
