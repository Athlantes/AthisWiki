## Welcome to Flint Required

Flint Required reimaginate the early game by rethinking some mechanics from vanilla Minecraft. Now, you can't break the wood with bare hands, that's why you will need some Flint Tools. You need to find the required materials if you want to progress further to the game, but it's ok, it's not that hard.

## New Tools - But not just that

Now, if you want to make some tools, you will need to find Flint, Plant Fiber and Sticks. Take the flint, smash it on a rock (RightClick on a Stone Block) and make Flint Shards. Combine the shards in crafting table to create Flint heads, and assemble those with a stick and a plant fiber to make your desired tool.

## More ways to get basic items

In Flint Required, there are more ways to get your resources. You can get Plant Fiber from Short Grass and Tall Grass. Also, if you break those
blocks with a Flint Knife, you have 100% chance of getting the fiber.

The flint can be gather as you know, by breaking Gravel. But you know how annoying is to not get the flint. Now, with Crude Brush you can brush
the Gravel into flint. You can make a Crude Brush by combining 3 sticks and a Plant Fiber in crafting.

Sticks was the hardest to get without being able to break trees, but now, that's not that hard. Instead of praying to get a stick when break leaves, now you can pray to get a sapling too. Every sapling is a stick if you put it in Crafting Table.

## I have Flint Tools. What Now?

Do you think of making Stone Tools? Not that fast. Now, stone tools require actually Stone, so you need to cook it. But the furnace is not the same as you know. To make a furnace, you need first to cook 8 pieces of cobblestone on a campfire, to get the necessary stone for that. Then you are free to bake as much stone as your coal can sustain.

## Why Flint Required?

Minecraft’s early game has always been about survival and creativity, but breaking trees with bare hands and jumping straight into stone tools can feel a little too easy. Flint Required slows the pace just enough to make those first steps memorable again. Every tool you craft feels earned, and every upgrade marks real progress. It’s not harder, it’s more immersive, more primal, and more fun.
